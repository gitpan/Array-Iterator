Revision history for Perl extension Array::Iterator.

0.07     2011-09-09 (Steven Haryanto)

         - Take over maintenance from Stevan Little.

         - Now uses Dist::Zilla and git.

         - Add lowercase method name aliases (has_next() as well as hasNext(),
           etc). The lowercase method names are now the documented ones.

         - Add iterated() to check whether an iteration has been done (i.e.
           next(), or get_next(), or previous(), etc has been called).

0.06 Fri July 8, 2005
    - Fixed bug in Array::Iterator::peek().
      Thanks to Hugo Cornelis for pointing it out
        - added tests for this
    - Added patch from Phillip Moore to support
      *single element iteration* using the hash-ref
      constructor option.
        - added tests and docs for this (also from Phillip :)

0.05 Mon July 15, 2004
    - added a getLegnth method and tested it
    - changed how currentIndex deals with index of 0, it
      now does it correctly.
    - made current use currentIndex to get the current
      index
    - made Array::Iterator more subclass friendly by adding
      some 'protected' methods to access some fields with
    - added some subclasses:
        - Array::Iterator::BiDirectional
        - Array::Iterator::Circular
        - Array::Iterator::Reusable
    - created tests for all these new modules

0.04 Thurs May 6 2004
    - Changed current and currentIndex to refer to the
      same value (and index) of the last item dispensed
      by the next method. This is more in line with what
      they should do. Prior to this version they returned
      the current index which was actually the one past the
      last call to next.
    - tested these changes and altered tests which used the
      old versions.
    - updated documentation to reflect change

0.03  Sun May 2 2004
    - Added currentIndex method, and added tests for it.
    - Added getNext method and added tests for it.
    - altered the behavior of peek to not throw an exception.
    - updated all documentation.
