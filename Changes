Revision history for Perl extension Array::Iterator.

0.04 Thurs May 6 2004
    - Changed current and currentIndex to refer to the 
      same value (and index) of the last item dispensed
      by the next method. This is more in line with what
      they should do. Prior to this version they returned
      the current index which was actually the one past the 
      last call to next.
    - tested these changes and altered tests which used the 
      old versions.
    - updated documentation to reflect change

0.03  Sun May 2 2004
    - Added currentIndex method, and added tests for it.
    - Added getNext method and added tests for it.
    - altered the behavior of peek to not throw an exception.
    - updated all documentation.
